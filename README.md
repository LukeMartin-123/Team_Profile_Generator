# Team_Profile_Generator

## Description
The goal of this assignment was to build an application that would auto-populate an HTML page with information on a companies team members based on user input. The team member information is displayed in cards on the HTML pager and there are multiple roles that can be chosen. All roles branch off the main "Employee" branch and then sub-roles include Manager, Engineer and Intern.

The application starts with the prompts for the "Manager" role. The prompts include asking for the Manager's name, Id number, email address and office number:

Once the manager's prompts are complete the user can either add an Enigeer or Intern next. If they choose Engineer they are asked to enter the Engineer's name, Id number, email address and github username:

They are then asked again if they'd like to add an Engineer or Intern. If Intern is chossen the user is asked what the Intern's name, Id number, email adress and school they attend is:

If these are all the employees the user wishes to add then they will select "Do not add another emplyee" and the HTML file with the employee information is then generated:
